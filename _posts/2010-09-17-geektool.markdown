Just a short post. I'm posting my GeekTools setup and a  screenshot. I'd make
some note about my awk skills being hacky, but I  think anything ran through awk
looks hacky.

    top -l1 | awk '
    BEGIN { ORS=" | " }
    /CPU usage/ { print "CPU: " $3 }
    /PhysMem/ { print "RAM Wired: " $2;
        print "RAM Active: " $4;
        print "RAM Used: " $6;
        print "RAM Free: " $8 }'
    echo ""
    df -H | awk '
    BEGIN { ORS=" | " }
    /disk0s2/ { print "SSD Size: " $2;
        print "SSD Used: " $3;
        print "SSD Avail: " $4;
        print "SSD Cap: " $5 }'
    echo ""
    ifconfig en1 | GREP inet | awk 'BEGIN { ORS=" | " } {print $1 ": " $2}'
