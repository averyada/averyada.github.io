title: Introducing My New Minimal Design
---

Recently I've been focusing a lot on the front end presentation of this website,
and I'd like to say this should be considered Beta 1 of the new minimal style
that I'm moving towards on this site.

I'm still finalizing the layout a bit and tweaking things here and there, and
I'm liable to have forgotten to style a lot of the standard HTML tags that
Markdown outputs when it converts my blog posts. Expect a bumpy ride, hopefully
it isn't too jarring.
