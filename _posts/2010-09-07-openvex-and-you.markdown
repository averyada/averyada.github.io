I'm currently taking a Robotics class at Butte College. The  only drawback to
this course is their insistence on using the “EasyC”  drag-and-drop programming
tool for their robots. This is fine for  beginners, and I understand the class
is aimed at novices and those  without heavy programming backgrounds. However,
for someone who knows  how to program this is boring. Extremely boring.

Thus I've been trying to get OpenVex to compile over the last few  days on my
Macbook Pro and Ubuntu install.  I've ran into numerous  problems trying to get
it to compile properly on OSX and Debian-based  distros. This library was
originally written in FreeBSD and as such it  has the best support for that
environment. I finally solved my problem  by using a FreeBSD virtual machine to
compile my files. For now, this is  a brief post to point people in the right
direction if they have  interest in OpenVex. I'll follow up with a more thorough
post of my  build environment and how I set it up later.
