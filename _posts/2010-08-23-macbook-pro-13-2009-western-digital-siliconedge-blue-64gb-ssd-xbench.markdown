I recently received a WD SiliconEdge Blue 64GB for a birthday gift and I
installed it in my 2009 13" Macbook Pro. Here are my HDD xbench results.

    Results 245.22
    System Info
    Xbench Version: 1.3
    System Version: 10.6.4 (10F569)
    Physical RAM: 2048 MB
    Model: MacBookPro5,5
    Drive Type: WDC SSC-D0064SC-2100
    Disk Test: 245.22
    Sequential: 160.35

    Uncached Read 693.46 128.68 MB/sec [256K blocks]

In short: Extremely fast. I've clocked my boot time at little under 8 seconds
from cold to desktop. This is a very impressive little drive and while it might
not have the performance an Intel SSD might have, it's very much so worth the
$140 price tag.
