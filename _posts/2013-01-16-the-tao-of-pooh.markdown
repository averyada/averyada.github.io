title: The Tao of Pooh
---

After stumbling upon a pretty convincing comment on Reddit describing the
quality of [The Tao of Pooh][1] by Benjamin Hoff I decided $8 was worth
satisfying my curiosity. I'm especially likely to impulsively buy a title like
this when it's brief enough I know I'll be able to finish it in a couple
sittings.

The Tao of Pooh is a book which attempts to explain Taoism through the
characters and events in Winnie The Pooh. This truly shows itself to be a great
idea, as the situations in 100 Akre Forest become the backdrop for demonstrating
insightful Taoist ideals. Not only that, but the characters are great
representations of different behavioral trends that we all exhibit at times.
It's effective enough I don't think I can ever see Winnie The Pooh in the same
light.

I found his book full of very useful, insightful information presented with very
clear and simple language. Benjamin was very precise in the observations he made
and the view points he described. The result is a read where the fundamentals of
Taoism shine through the beautifully simple language A.A. Milne used in the
original Winnie The Pooh. The gap between Lao-Tse and Milne is bridged easily
by Hoff's own commentary.

This is a title I'll definitely be recommending to friends, if only for the
educational value and insight into Eastern philosophy.
