title: "Missing images and out of date posts"
---

There are a few posts that have broken images, due to having a less than
bullet-proof image system. On top of that, some posts are just completely
out of date due to the age of the topic it's written about.

These posts are going to be generally updated and removed if they're just
completely useless due to their age. Additionally, a more robust blog system
is in the works that will revamp this entire site.
