    <h1>I'm Blaine Pace</h1>
    <p>
    Hello! Welcome to my Jekyll-powered blog, where I write about things
    generally related to programming and software development. My name's Blaine
    Pace, I'm a student at 
    <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/">California State University, Chico</a> 
    and a part-time professional
    <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> developer.
    </p>

    <p>
    I put this blog together to learn more about mobile responsive design in
    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">ZURB Foundation</a>
    and to share projects I've worked on. I'm a
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FOSS</a>
    proponent and like to talk about different Linux
    distributions, and share common problems I come across using libre
    software.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I've been known to do some work from time to time with hardware platforms
    such as
    <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>.
    You might also see a post or two about my
    hardware experiments when I find time to pick up a soldering iron.
