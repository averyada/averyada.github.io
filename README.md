# pacebl.github.io

This is my tech blog powered by [Jekyll][jek] and hosted by [Github][gh]. I'm
Blaine Pace, and I collect my personal thoughts and opinions here. Sometimes
I'll be writing about the random technology in my life, from IP cameras to linux
distributions. Other times I'll be sharing experiences I've had writing software
and working with different programming languages.
